## Database Normalization

**Definition**: The process of organizing data in a database to enhance integrity by reducing redundancy.

**Steps for Database Normalization**:
  1. Identify and organize data into tables.
  2. Eliminate redundant data by grouping related information.
  3. Define primary keys for each table.
  4. Organize tables to minimize data redundancy.
  5. Address dependencies between columns.
  6. Normalize further if needed, ensuring data integrity.

**Importance**:

1. **Data Integrity**: Reduces duplication, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

2. **Efficient Storage**: Eliminates redundant data, optimizing disk space usage.

3. **Query Performance**: Enhances performance in complex queries, minimizing table joins.

4. **Ease of Maintenance**: Simplifies updates and maintenance, reducing inconsistencies.

5. **Scalability**: Supports easy scalability with well-organized data structures.

6. **Redundancy Reduction**: Minimizes anomalies during data modifications, ensuring consistency.


Normalization is crucial for creating robust, efficient database systems, providing reliable data for diverse applications.
