**Table Structure with Violation of First Normal Form (1NF):**

Consider a table named "EmployeeInfo" in a company's HR database:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName   | Skills               |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1          | John Doe       | Java, Python, SQL    |
| 2          | Jane Smith     | C++, JavaScript      |
| 3          | Bob Johnson    | Python, HTML, CSS    |

The "Skills" column in this table violates First Normal Form (1NF) by storing skills as a comma-separated string within a single cell.

**Solution to Achieve First Normal Form (1NF):**

To conform to 1NF, split the "Skills" attribute into a separate table named "EmployeeSkills."

**New "EmployeeSkills" Table:**

| EmployeeID | Skill     |
|------------|----------|
| 1          | Java     |
| 1          | Python   |
| 1          | SQL      |
| 2          | C++      |
| 2          | JavaScript |
| 3          | Python   |
| 3          | HTML     |
| 3          | CSS      |

**Revised "EmployeeInfo" Table:**

Update the "EmployeeInfo" table to reference the "EmployeeSkills" table using "EmployeeID" as a foreign key:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | 
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | John Doe     |
| 2          | Jane Smith   |
| 3          | Bob Johnson  |

By separating the "Skills" attribute into the "EmployeeSkills" table and referencing it in "EmployeeInfo," we achieve 1NF. Each attribute now contains only atomic values, improving data integrity and facilitating database management and querying.
