## Relational Query Languages

**1. SQL Basics:**

* **Keywords:** Predefined words like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, etc., defining specific actions and clauses.
* **Operators:** Mathematical (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`<`, `>`, `=`, `!=`), and logical (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) operators work on data values.
* **Expressions:** Combine operators, constants, and functions to represent conditions and calculations.
* **Clauses:** Building blocks of a query, each with a specific purpose:
    * **SELECT:** Specifies the columns to retrieve.
    * **FROM:** Identifies the table(s) to read data from.
    * **WHERE:** Filters rows based on a condition.
    * **GROUP BY:** Groups rows based on a column and applies aggregate functions.
    * **HAVING:** Filters groups based on an aggregate function result.
    * **ORDER BY:** Sorts the results based on a column.

**2. Beyond the Basics:**

* **Subqueries:** Queries nested within another query, offering powerful data filtering and retrieval capabilities.
* **Joins:** Combine data from multiple tables based on relationships, enabling insightful analysis across entities.
* **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** SQL commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` allow modifying data within the database.
* **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Create, modify, and drop tables, columns, and other database objects.
* **Functions:** Built-in or user-defined functions perform calculations and manipulate data for complex analysis.

ü§îüçÉ‚≠ê Alternative query languages exist for specific purposes:

* **NoSQL query languages:** Handle unstructured and distributed data efficiently.
* **Domain-specific query languages:** Cater to specific data models and applications.
