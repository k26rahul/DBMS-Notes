- Parallel Processing

  - Simultaneous execution of tasks
  - Speeds up data processing
  - Multiple CPUs or nodes used
  - Task divided into subtasks
  - Improves performance and scalability
  - Common in big data, databases, rendering
  - Challenges: synchronization, load balancing

- Parallel Processing Examples
  - **Distributed Databases:** Querying data across multiple nodes.
  - **Data Analytics:** Processing large datasets faster by distributing tasks.
  - **Web Servers:** Handling multiple user requests concurrently.
