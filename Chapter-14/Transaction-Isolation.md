## Transaction Isolation

- **Definition:**
  - *Guarantees* that transactions operate independently, free from interference.
  - ðŸ’¡ *Visual Analogy:* Transactions should be like separate bubbles â€“ they shouldn't interfere with each other.

- **Levels of Isolation:**

  - **Read Uncommitted:**
    - *Description:* Similar to peeking into someone else's shopping cart before they've paid.
    - *Behavior:* Allows transactions to read data that has been modified but not committed, risking exposure to incomplete or inconsistent changes.
    - *Use Case:* Rarely used due to the potential for dirty reads (reading uncommitted data).

  - **Read Committed:**
    - *Description:* You only see the changes that have been officially "checked out."
    - *Behavior:* Ensures that transactions only read data that has been committed, preventing dirty reads.
    - *Use Case:* Commonly used to balance data consistency and performance in situations where slight delays in data visibility are acceptable.

  - **Repeatable Read:**
    - *Description:* Prevents others from messing with your data while you're working.
    - *Behavior:* Guarantees that if a piece of data is read during a transaction, it will remain unchanged throughout the transaction's lifespan.
    - *Use Case:* Useful when a transaction needs to maintain a consistent view of the data without worrying about changes made by other transactions.

  - **Serializable:**
    - *Description:* The highest level, ensuring no one can sneak in any changes.
    - *Behavior:* Provides the strictest isolation by preventing all types of anomalies, including dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
    - *Use Case:* Critical for scenarios where data consistency is paramount, even if it comes at the cost of some performance.


## In simpler terms:

1. **Read Uncommitted:**
   - *Purpose:* Allows transactions to read data even if it's not officially confirmed, enabling high concurrency.
   - *Example:* Checking an online shopping cart while someone is still adding items â€“ you might see changes that aren't final.

2. **Read Committed:**
   - *Purpose:* Ensures transactions only see data that has been officially "checked out," reducing the chance of errors.
   - *Example:* Viewing your bank balance after a transaction is complete â€“ you see the confirmed result, not the temporary changes.

3. **Repeatable Read:**
   - *Purpose:* Guarantees that once you read data, it won't change until your transaction is done, providing a stable view.
   - *Example:* Reading a news article without worrying that the content might change while you're still reading.

4. **Serializable:**
   - *Purpose:* Offers the highest level of certainty, preventing any changes to data you've read until your transaction is finished.
   - *Example:* Making an airline reservation â€“ once you check seat availability, it's reserved for you until you confirm or cancel.

## Real life examples:

- **Read Uncommitted:** Like looking at a work-in-progress document that someone is still editing.
  
- **Read Committed:** Similar to seeing the final version of a document after someone has officially saved it.

- **Repeatable Read:** Imagine reading a book, and once you start a chapter, you're ensured that the content won't change until you finish reading the chapter.

- **Serializable:** It's like having exclusive access to a document â€“ no one else can make changes until you're done with it.

## Where They Play Their Role:

- **Choosing the Right Level:** Based on the nature of the application.
  
- **High Concurrency Needs:** Read Uncommitted for scenarios where quick access to data is more critical than absolute correctness.

- **Balancing Consistency and Performance:** Read Committed is a common choice for a balance between consistency and performance.

- **Need for Stability:** Repeatable Read when maintaining a consistent view of data is crucial.

- **Absolute Data Consistency:** Serializable for scenarios where data consistency is non-negotiable, even if it means a potential impact on performance.
