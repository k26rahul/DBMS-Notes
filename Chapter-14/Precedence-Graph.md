## Precedence Graph

ğŸ’¡ This represents a simple visual representation of the order in which tasks (transactions) should occur to maintain consistency.

- *Simple Explanation:* A precedence graph is like a map that shows the relationships between different tasks (transactions) in a schedule.
  
- *Why is it Used?* It helps us see which tasks depend on others and ensures that transactions are executed in a sensible order.
  
- *Example:* Think of it as a family tree. Each person (task/transaction) is connected to others, showing who came before or after.

- *Building the Graph:* 
  - *Arrows:* Represent the order of actions â€“ from the task that happened first to the one that followed.
  - *Circles:* Tasks (transactions) are shown as circles, and arrows connect them based on their order.

- *Checking for Serializability:* 
  - *No Circles:* If there are no circles in the graph, it means the schedule is good, and transactions can be executed in a way that makes sense.

- *Example Scenario:* 
```
Task A -----> Task B
   |             |
   v             v
Task C -----> Task D
```

In this example:
- Task A and Task C can happen independently.
- Task B depends on Task A (there's an arrow from A to B).
- Task D depends on both Task B and Task C (arrows from B and C to D).
