## Question

Discuss the concept of **multi-table clustering file organization** as a file storage technique. Consider the following relations:

### Domain Relation

| ID    | Name   | Dept_Name | Salary |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 10101 | Bob    | R&D       | 65000  |
| 33456 | Clay   | Finance   | 85000  |
| 41565 | Robert | R&D       | 75000  |
| 50021 | Michael| R&D       | 50000  |

### Employee Relation

| Domain  | Venue   | Budget  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| R&D     | Matthew | 900000  |
| Finance | Smith   | 700000  |

Write an SQL query that computes a natural join of the Domain and the Employee relations. Show the resultant multi-table clustering file structure.

## Multi-table Clustering File Organization in this Scenario

In a multi-table clustering file organization, related records from multiple tables are stored physically close together on the same storage unit. This improves performance for frequently joined tables with a shared key attribute.

ðŸ‘‰ The `domain` and `employee` tables have a strong relationship through the `dept_name` attribute. A multi-table clustering file organization could significantly improve the performance of natural joins between these tables.

Here's how it would work:

1. **Data Organization:**
    - Both tables would be physically stored in the same file, divided into clusters.
    - Each cluster would contain records from both tables where the `dept_name` values are the same.
    - Records within a cluster would be ordered by their primary key (e.g., `ID` for `employee` and `name` for `domain`).

2. **Natural Join Performance:**
    - When joining the tables, the database only needs to read the relevant cluster(s) based on the join condition (`dept_name`).
    - Within the cluster, records are already physically close, minimizing disk seeks and improving efficiency.

**SQL Query and Resultant File Structure:**

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT e.ID, e.name, e.salary, d.venue, d.budget
FROM employee e
NATURAL JOIN domain d
ON e.dept_name = d.name;
```

**Resultant Multitable Clustering File Structure:**

```
| dept_name | ID   | name     | salary   |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| R&D       | 10101| Bob      | 65000    |
| R&D       | 41565| Robert   | 75000    |
| R&D       | 50021| Michael  | 50000    |
| Finance   | 33456| Clay     | 85000    |
| ...       | ...  | ...      | ...      |
```

In this structure, records with the same "dept_name" are clustered together, and within each department, records are further clustered based on the "ID" values. 

- Clusters:
    - Cluster 1: Records for `R&D` department (Bob, Robert, Michael)
    - Cluster 2: Records for `Finance` department (Clay)

Within each cluster:
- `employee` records ordered by `ID`

**Benefits:**

- Significantly faster natural joins due to physical proximity of related records.
- Reduced disk I/O due to minimized disk seeks.
- Improved query performance for operations involving both tables.

**Drawbacks:**

- File maintenance can be more complex due to interdependencies between tables.
- Less efficient for queries involving only one table or with different join conditions.
