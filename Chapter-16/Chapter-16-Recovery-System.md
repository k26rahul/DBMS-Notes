## DBMS Chapter 16 Recovery System

**16.1 Failure Classification:**

* **Transaction failures:**
    * **Logical errors:** Internal issues like bad input, data not found, overflow, or resource limits.
    * **System errors:** Deadlocks or other undesirable system states preventing normal execution.
* **System crashes:** Hardware malfunctions, software bugs, or power outages cause data loss in volatile storage and halt transaction processing.

**16.2 Storage:**

* **Database storage hierarchy:** Main memory, disk storage, archival storage.
* **Data structures:** Pages, files, indexes.
* **Transactions and concurrency control:** ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and isolation levels.

**16.3 Recovery and Atomicity:**

* **Recovery manager:** Ensures the database remains consistent despite failures.
* **ARIES (Atomic Recoverable In-place Serialization):** Popular recovery algorithm ensuring atomicity.
* **Undo and redo logging:** Tracking changes for rollback on failures and redo on recovery.
* **Checkpoints:** Periodic snapshots of database state for faster recovery.

**16.4 Recovery Algorithm:**

* **Analysis phase:** Identifies committed and uncommitted transactions at crash time.
* **Redo phase:** Applies redo log records to bring committed transactions to completion.
* **Undo phase:** Reverses uncommitted transactions using undo log records.
* **Checkpointing and incremental recovery:** Improves efficiency by focusing on changes since last checkpoint.

**16.5 Buffer Management:**

* **Buffer manager:** Manages data pages in main memory buffers for efficient access.
* **Dirty page table:** Tracks pages with updates needing flush to disk.
* **Buffer replacement strategies:** LRU, MRU, CLOCK, etc., to determine pages to evict when buffer fills.

**16.6 Failure with Loss of Nonvolatile Storage:**

* **Mirror disks:** Duplicates of disk storage for immediate failover.
* **RAID:** Disk arrays with redundancy for fault tolerance.
* **Remote disks and tapes:** Off-site backups for disaster recovery.

**16.7 Early Lock Release and Logical Undo Operations:**

* **Early lock release:** Releases locks held by transactions during undo for faster recovery.
* **Logical undo:** Reverses effects of operations without physically rewriting data.

**16.8 ARIES:**

* **Detailed explanation of ARIES recovery algorithm:**
    * Shadow paging for redo/undo operations.
    * Write-ahead logging (WAL) for durability.
    * Checkpointing for incremental recovery.
* **ARIES properties:** Atomicity, serializability, and durability.

**16.9 Remote Backup Systems:**

* **Types of remote backups:** Full, incremental, differential.
* **Backup scheduling and retention policies:** Balancing backup frequency and storage costs.
* **Remote backup servers and data replication:** Off-site disaster recovery solutions.
