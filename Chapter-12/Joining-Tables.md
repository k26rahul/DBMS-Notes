### Joining Tables:

In a relational database, you often have multiple tables, and you might need to combine information from different tables. This is where **joins** come in.

#### Types of Joins:

1. **Inner Join:**
   - Retrieves rows from both tables where there is a match based on a specified condition (usually equality of a column).

2. **Outer Join (Left, Right, Full Outer):**
   - Retrieves matching rows as well as non-matching rows from one or both tables.

### Nested Loop Join (Traditional Join):

In a **nested loop join**, each row from the first table is paired with every row from the second table to find matches. It's like a nested loop in programming:

#### Example:
```
Table A                        Table B
| ID | Name   |                 | ID | Age |
|----|--------|                 |----|-----|
| 1  | Alice  |                 | 2  | 25  |
| 2  | Bob    |                 | 1  | 30  |
| 3  | Charlie|                 | 4  | 22  |
```

With a nested loop join, you compare every combination of rows from Table A with Table B:


```
| ID | Name   | ID | Age |
|----|--------|----|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 2  | 25  |  (Comparison)
| 1  | Alice  | 1  | 30  |  (Comparison, matched*)
| 1  | Alice  | 4  | 22  |  (Comparison)
| 2  | Bob    | 2  | 25  |  (Comparison, matched*)
| 2  | Bob    | 1  | 30  |  (Comparison)
| 2  | Bob    | 4  | 22  |  (Comparison)
| 3  | Charlie| 2  | 25  |  (Comparison)
| 3  | Charlie| 1  | 30  |  (Comparison)
| 3  | Charlie| 4  | 22  |  (Comparison)
```

### Hash Join:

Now, consider a **hash join**:

#### Example Tables:
```
Table A                        Table B
| ID | Name   |                 | ID | Age |
|----|--------|                 |----|-----|
| 1  | Alice  |                 | 2  | 25  |
| 2  | Bob    |                 | 1  | 30  |
| 3  | Charlie|                 | 4  | 22  |
```

#### Hashing Phase:
Hash tables are created for both tables based on a specific column (e.g., ID).

#### Partitioning:
Rows are hashed and placed into partitions based on the hash values.

#### Probing and Comparison:
Only tuples with the same hash code are considered for comparison:

```
| ID | Name   | Age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 30  |  (Comparison, matched*)
| 2  | Bob    | 25  |  (Comparison, matched*)
```

### Conclusion:

- **Nested Loop Join:** Compares every combination of rows.
- **Hash Join:** Uses hashing to efficiently identify and compare only potentially matching rows.

ðŸ‘‰ Joins are fundamental to relational databases, allowing you to extract meaningful information by combining data from different tables based on common attributes.
ðŸ‘‰ Hash joins provide a more efficient way of achieving this by leveraging hashing techniques.
