## What are the Mobile App constraints? Illustrate the typical architecture of a mobile app with a suitable diagram.

**Mobile App Constraints:**
1. Limited Resources:
   - Limited processing, memory, and battery.

2. Network Variability:
   - Unpredictable network conditions.

3. Device Fragmentation:
   - Diverse devices, screen sizes, and capabilities.

4. Security Concerns:
   - Vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access.

**Typical Mobile App Architecture:**
```
+---------------------------+
| Presentation Layer (UI)   |

| Data Layer (Backend)      |
+---------------------------+
```
- **Presentation Layer:** User interface.
- **Application Layer:** Logic and processing.
- **Data Layer:** Manages storage and communication.
