`Reduction to Relational Schemas` is the process of structuring and organizing data in a way that can be represented as tables (relations) in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

**Scenario**: Imagine you're tasked with creating a database to manage a library's book collection. You have a conceptual data model that includes the following entity:

- Entity: Books
  - Attributes: ISBN (International Standard Book Number), Title, Author, Genre, and Published Year.

Here's how you would reduce this conceptual model to relational schemas:

**1. Relational Schema**:
   - Create a relational schema that represents the data structure for the database. In this case, we'll create a single table to represent the `Books` entity.

**2. Mapping Entities to Tables**:
   - The `Books` entity in the conceptual model becomes a `Books` table in the relational schema. This table will store information about books.

**3. Attributes to Columns**:
   - Map each attribute from the conceptual model to columns in the `Books` table.

**4. Primary Keys**:
   - To ensure each book's uniqueness, designate the `ISBN` as the primary key for the `Books` table. This guarantees that every book record can be uniquely identified using its ISBN.

**Books Table**:
| ISBN       | Title          | Author      | Genre   | Published Year |
|------------|----------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| 978-0451524935 | `1984`     | George Orwell | Fiction | 1949          |
| 978-0061120084 | `To Kill a Mockingbird` | Harper Lee | Fiction | 1960 |
| ...        | ...            | ...         | ...     | ...             |

ðŸ‘‰ In this example, the `Books` entity from the conceptual data model is reduced to a relational schema, which is represented as a table in a relational database. Each attribute maps to a column, and the `ISBN` is designated as the primary key for unique identification.

ðŸ‘‰ This process simplifies the data model and makes it ready for database implementation, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and management of the library's book collection.
